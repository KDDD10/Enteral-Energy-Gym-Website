# Eternal Energy Gym Responsive Website

![Website Mock Up](       )

## Purpose
This website was created for the sole purpose of completing the first Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Web Application Development course. It was built using the knowledge I gained from HTML, CSS and User Centric Design modules. 

The Eternal Energy Gym website was created at the request of the Eternal Energy Gym company. The client had asked for a fully responsive website that can be used to advertise their gym as well as qualities that make them different compared to other gyms. In doing this, they hope that this will increase the amount of people would use their gym and recommend it to others.

The live website can be found here [here](https://37a10195-e203-4820-9e93-132c4aa1d8fd-00-bbtrksas731q.worf.replit.dev/)

## Structure

Th home page gives details on what it wants the user to understand, giving multiple details of the gym.
This is done in order to fulfill the user story:

To make it easier for users to navigate the website, every page will include a navigation menu at the top that leads to a new page.
To conserve space on smaller devices, the navigation menu on a mobile device will be able collapse in size.

The website will be made responsive through the use of media queries and/or the Boostrap Grid system by using custom CSS and/or Bootstrap.

Every page will adjust its layout according to the size of the screen and will be responsive. This is done to make sure that the content flows well, that images are viewed correctly, and that the text is not jumbled into tiny, unreadable chunks that are side by side.

## Design
### Colour Scheme 
The main colours used are Gold, White & Black. The most of the colours are black and white but I decided to add Gold to it too as when I was testing it seemed to be a colour that standed out on the Home Page. They seemed to compliment each other without being over powering to the eyes of any user. 
### Typography
The headers on all pages throughout the website is using the **Lato** Font while the rest of the main text is using the **Oswald** font.
### Images
The images used in this project were sourced from different websites. These were [iStock](https://www.istockphoto.com/) and [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/)

## Testing

#### Summary
Time for honesty, I didn't do any testing. I didn't realise that I had to do multiple tests on different web browsers and record the results. So unfornately I have nothing to show in this section.

## Deployment
Another moment of honesty. I was using 'Replit' to do my work for the past few weeks. Once it came round to the last week, I found out I had to use Github and link all my work together. As well as use it to make commits to

## Comments

There are a few things I wanted to make clear so that it's easier to understand why some things are the way they are in this readme file as well as the whole Project. 
* The link to my website is on a differentb platform. This is because I didn't use Github or any suitable developing platform. I used 'Replit'. By the time I realised that I had to put all my work on another platform, I struggled to make it work and it was too late. So I decided to just to keep things how they were and hope for the best.
* I didn't keep track of every website I used to help me along the way. It's purely my fault as I should've been more careful when reading the criteria

As I explained before, I came across multiple challenges. Challenges that held me back to completing the project properly. It's my own fault and I've learnt from it. I gave it my a good try and I truly believed I've come a long way form the start and end of this first project.
