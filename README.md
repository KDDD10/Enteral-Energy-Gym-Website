# Eternal Energy Gym Responsive Website

![Website Mock Up](       )

## Purpose
This website was created for the sole purpose of completing the first Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Web Application Development course. It was built using the knowledge I gained from HTML, CSS and User Centric Design modules. 

The Eternal Energy Gym website was created at the request of the Eternal Energy Gym company. The client had asked for a fully responsive website that can be used to advertise their gym as well as qualities that make them different compared to other gyms. In doing this, they hope that this will increase the amount of people would use their gym and recommend it to others.

The live website can be found here [here](https://37a10195-e203-4820-9e93-132c4aa1d8fd-00-bbtrksas731q.worf.replit.dev/)

## Structure


> As a First Time User, I want to be able to quickly grasp the site's main purpose.

To make it easier for users to navigate the website, every page will include a navigation menu at the top that leads to a new page.
To conserve space on smaller devices, the navigation menu on a mobile device will be able collapse in size.
This is done in order to fulfill the user story:

> As a First Time User, I want to be able to quickly browse the website and locate all of its material.




> As a First Time User, I want to be able to clearly view the website and content on different devices.


> As a First Time User, I would want to follow the Gym on various social media networks.

## Comments

There are a few things I wanted to make clear so that it's easier to understand why some things are the way they are in this readme file. 
* The link to my website is on a differentb platform. This is because I didn't use Github or any suitable developing platform. I used 'Replit'. By the time I realised that I had to put all my work on another platform, I struggled to make it work and it was too late. So I decided to just to keep things how they were and hope for the best.
* 

As I explained before, I came across multiple challenges. Challenges that held me back to completing the project properly. I gave it my best shot and I truly believed I've come a long way form the start and end of this first project.
